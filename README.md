Thermodynamic Calculator with PyQt. Delta G, Delta E, and Reaction Balancing. This project uses PyQt to create a user-friendly graphical user interface for calculating two thermodynamic quantities in reactions: Gibbs free energy change and potential change in redox reactions in water and also does reaction balancing for redox reactions in water
